# PteroThemes (not mine i just forked it)
 Themes for Pterodactyl 1.x, NON-maintained atm

## Will this break my panel? (IMPORTANT)
This will not break your panel unless you use a diffrent theme version for a diffrent panel version, if it for some reason does break your panel it is simple to remove the theme.

## Panel Versioning
Make sure that the theme you are installing corresponds with the version of the panel you are running; no help will be given if you have mismatched versions!

How do i use them?
You simple follow the instructions below, mainly consisting of two or three changes you need to make before you build your panel.

## Install Theme
You can either manually install them OR, you can use my friend neon's install scripts for them:

If you install the theme with the community made install script no support will be given. Please debug your error with the official install instructions that are below.

# User Side
Create a file called main.css in `/var/www/pterodactyl/resources/scripts`

In that file put this text

```@import url(https://oreokitten.github.io/latest/dark-n-purple/user.css);```


After that edit the file index.tsx in /var/www/pterodactyl/resources/scripts

On line 6 at the end of the imports add this

```import './main.css';```
After this build the panel, you can find information of how to do that scroll down

After that just reload your panel and the theme is applied.

In the file admin.blade.php in `/var/www/pterodactyl/resources/views/layouts/`

## Rebuild
# Install Dependencies

# Install NodeJS
TIP

You may have to add sudo to the following commands if you are not root.

# Using Nodesource
# Ubuntu/Debian
`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -`

`apt install -y nodejs`

# CentOS
`curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -`

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash`

`nvm install node`

`nvm alias default node`

`nvm use node`

`node -v` should say 12.20.0 or newer
